  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Serves: 6 people | Time: 20 minutes</p>

  <p><strong>Trader Joe’s Beef Birria</strong> is tender, slow-cooked beef in a flavorful broth made with crushed tomatoes, dried chiles, and aromatic spices and often served as a simple stew. If you want to evoke the taco truck vibe at home—and we’re thinking you do—you can make your own Birria tacos. But if your mantra is “everything is better with cheese,” then make Quesabirria tacos!</p>

  <p>We dip corn tortillas in the savory broth and fry them in a hot pan, top them with Birria and shredded mozzarella cheese, then sprinkle chopped onions and cilantro and fold into a taco. We suggest frying each side until the tortillas are crispy and the cheese is gloriously gooey and begins to brown at the edges. But don’t stop there—that lusciously spiced broth serves as a delectable dip for your tacos, too. Believe us, you’ll want to spoon, dip, and sip every last drop.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
    <li>6 Trader Joe's Corn Tortilla</li>
    <li>1 package Trader Joe's Beef Birria, prepared according to package instructions</li>
    <li>1.5 cup shredded mozzarella</li>
    <li>1 small white onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 cilantro bunch, chopped</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Heat grill pan, plancha, or large frying pan over medium heat and add oil.</li>
    <li>Dip one side of the tortilla in the prepared Birria broth, then lay the tortilla, broth side down, on the pan.</li>
    <li>Add cheese to half of the tortilla and the heated shredded birria to the other. Top both sides with chopped cilantro and onion.</li>
    <li>Using tongs, fold the tortilla, gently pressing it together. Cook for 2-3 minute until crisp. Then flip and continue cooking for another 2-3 minutes, until both sides are crispy.</li>
    <li>Remove from pan, and top taco with more chopped onion and cilantro.</li>
    <li>Repeat with remaining tortillas, and serve.</li>
